# eloquent-js-info-the-js-way-exercises

This repo is a holding area for tasks done on the following documentation sites:

https://eloquentjavascript.net/
https://javascript.info/
https://github.com/thejsway/thejsway


## Purpose
<br/>
The main purpose of the repo is referencing and transparency in doing the exercises.

I also felt it was necessary as a way of working, to keep pushing work to github to build
muscle memory in how I produce code and content.
